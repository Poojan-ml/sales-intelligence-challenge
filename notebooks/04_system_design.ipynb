They want a system that **tells them when something is wrong**, **explains why**, and **recommends what to do**. The shift is from passive analytics to proactive decision intelligence.\n\n**Core design principle — Execution over Profile:** Parts 2-3 showed that deal characteristics (industry, region, product, lead source) have near-zero predictive power for outcomes. The strongest signal — by a wide margin — is *who works the deal* (rep-industry fit creates a 50pp win rate spread). This system is built around that finding: it prioritizes execution-quality metrics (RSFS, rep-deal matching, co-lead partnerships) over deal-profile scoring. This is what differentiates it from generic CRM analytics that treat all pipeline equally.\n\n---\n\n## Business Case\n\nParts 2-3 identified ~$4M in addressable revenue gap:\n\n| Lever | Mechanism | Est. Revenue Impact |\n|-------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Co-lead partnerships | Top-3 industry co-leads for RED-flagged deals | ~$1.1M |\n| Rep coaching to median | Via partnerships + targeted training | ~$2.9M |\n| **Total** | | **~$4.0M** |\n\nThis system exists to **capture that gap** — not by generating more pipeline (volume is already healthy), but by improving conversion efficiency through better rep-deal matching and structured coaching.\n\n---\n\n## High-Level Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐\n│   DATA SOURCES  │     │   COMPUTE LAYER      │     │  DELIVERY LAYER     │\n│                 │     │                      │     │                     │\n│  CRM (SFDC/    │───>│  Ingestion &          │───>│  CRO Dashboard      │\n│  HubSpot)      │     │  Normalization        │     │  (Real-time)        │\n│                 │     │       │               │     │                     │\n│  Calendar/     │───>│       v               │───>│  Slack/Email Alerts  │\n│  Activity Data │     │  Metric Engine        │     │  (Event-driven)     │\n│                 │     │  - RSFS (per deal)    │     │                     │\n│  Revenue Data  │───>│  - SMI (per segment)  │───>│  Weekly Digest       │\n│  (Billing)     │     │  - Win Rate           │     │  (Scheduled)        │\n│                 │     │       │               │     │                     │\n└─────────────────┘     │       v               │     │  Co-Lead            │\n                        │  Driver Model         │───>│  Recommendations    │\n                        │  (Weekly retrain)     │     │  (Per-deal)         │\n                        │       │               │     │                     │\n                        │       v               │     │  Monthly Rep Audit  │\n                        │  Co-Lead Matching     │     │  (Scheduled)        │\n                        │  Engine               │     │                     │\n                        │  - RED deal triage    │     └─────────────────────┘\n                        │  - Top-3 round-robin  │\n                        │  - Workload balancing │     ┌─────────────────────┐\n                        │       │               │     │  STORAGE            │\n                        │       v               │───>│  - Metric history   │\n                        │  Alert Engine         │     │  - Alert log        │\n                        │  (Threshold +         │     │  - Model versions   │\n                        │   Anomaly)            │     │  - Rep audit history│\n                        │                      │     └─────────────────────┘\n                        └──────────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## Data Flow\n\n### 1. Ingestion (Every 6 hours)\n\n| Step | What | Why |\n|------|------|-----|\n| Pull from CRM | Sync all deals updated in last 24h | Incremental, not full reload |\n| Validate schema | Check required fields present, types correct | Catch CRM config changes early |\n| Normalize | Map custom fields to standard schema | Different customers use different CRM setups |\n| Enrich | Add derived fields (quarter, cycle bucket, RSFS) | Pre-compute for faster downstream |\n| Store | Append to time-series table | Keep history for trend analysis |\n\n### 2. Metric Computation (Daily at 6 AM)\n\n| Metric | Schedule | Window |\n|--------|----------|--------|\n| Win rate (overall + segmented) | Daily | Rolling 90 days |\n| RSFS (per deal) | On deal creation/assignment | Rolling 12 months of history |\n| SMI (per segment) | Weekly | Quarter-over-quarter |\n| Driver model | Weekly | Full historical |\n| Pipeline velocity | Daily | Rolling 30 days |\n\n### 3. Co-Lead Matching (After RSFS computation)\n\nWhen a deal is created or a rep is assigned, the system:\n\n1. **Computes RSFS** for the deal (rep's historical win rate in that industry)\n2. **Flags the deal** as RED (< 25th percentile), YELLOW (< median), or GREEN (>= median)\n3. **For RED deals:** assigns a co-lead using the top-3 round-robin strategy from Part 3:\n   - Identifies the 3 highest-RSFS reps for that industry\n   - Assigns via round-robin to balance workload\n   - The co-lead provides strategic guidance (key decisions, customer calls); the original rep handles execution\n   - This doubles as coaching — the original rep learns industry patterns from the co-lead over time\n\n**Why co-lead partnerships, not reassignment:** Part 3 showed full reassignment would double some reps' workloads (42 → 77 deals) while leaving others idle. Co-lead partnerships keep the advisory burden manageable (~50-80% of own deal count) while creating built-in knowledge transfer.\n\n### 4. Alert Evaluation (After each metric computation)\n\nCheck thresholds and trigger alerts if conditions met.\n\n### 5. Monthly Rep Audit\n\nOnce per month, the system runs the three-tier rep classification from Part 3:\n- **Top Performers** — above industry median in most industries (natural co-leads)\n- **Specialists** — exceptional in specific industries, poor in others (routing fix, not coaching)\n- **Needs Coaching** — below industry median across most industries\n\nThis feeds back into co-lead assignments and coaching recommendations.\n\n---\n\n## Example Alerts & Insights\n\n### Alert Type 1: Metric Threshold Breach\n```\nALERT: Win Rate Below Threshold\n------------------------------------\nSeverity: HIGH\nMetric:   Win Rate (rolling 90-day)\nCurrent:  41.2%\nThreshold: 43.0%\nTrend:    Declining for 4 consecutive weeks\n\nContext:\n  Biggest contributor: Inbound leads (win rate dropped 8pp)\n  Affected segments:  FinTech (-6.7pp), Core product (-5.4pp)\n\nRecommended action:\n  > Audit inbound lead qualification criteria\n  > Review Core product positioning for FinTech buyers\n```\n\n### Alert Type 2: Segment Momentum Shift\n```\nALERT: Negative Momentum Detected\n------------------------------------\nSeverity: MEDIUM\nSegment:  lead_source: Inbound\nSMI:      -0.022 (most negative across all segments)\nDetail:   Win rate dropped from 48.8% to 40.5% while representing\n          26% of pipeline volume.\n\nContext:\n  This segment's decline is the single largest contributor to\n  overall win rate erosion this quarter.\n\nRecommended action:\n  > Check if marketing campaigns changed in the last quarter\n  > Review lead scoring model for inbound channels\n  > Consider tightening MQL -> SQL criteria\n```\n\n### Alert Type 3: Co-Lead Recommendation\n```\nDEAL FLAG: Low Rep-Segment Fit — Co-Lead Assigned\n------------------------------------\nDeal:     D04521 (HealthTech, APAC, Core, Outbound)\nRep:      rep_19\nRSFS:     0.28 (RED — bottom quartile)\nAge:      47 days (past 30-day sweet spot)\nAmount:   $42,300\n\nRisk factors:\n  - Rep wins only 28% of HealthTech deals historically\n  - Sales cycle exceeds optimal window\n\nCo-lead assignment:\n  > Paired with rep_23 (65% HealthTech win rate) as co-lead\n  > rep_23 provides strategic guidance on HealthTech positioning\n  > rep_19 continues execution; learns HealthTech patterns\n  > Expected lift: +37pp win probability for this deal\n\nAlternative co-leads if rep_23 unavailable:\n  > rep_07 (52% HealthTech), rep_11 (48% HealthTech)\n```\n\n### Alert Type 4: Monthly Rep Audit Summary\n```\nMONTHLY REP AUDIT — January 2024\n------------------------------------\nTeam: 25 reps evaluated across 5 industries\n\nClassification:\n  TOP PERFORMERS:   8 reps (above industry median in 4+ industries)\n  SPECIALISTS:      6 reps (>10pp above median in best, >10pp below in worst)\n  AVERAGE:          7 reps (mixed performance, no extreme gaps)\n  NEEDS COACHING:   4 reps (below median in 3+ industries)\n\nKey actions:\n  SPECIALISTS — routing changes recommended:\n  > rep_23: route to HealthTech/EdTech only (65%/58% WR)\n    STOP assigning SaaS deals (24% WR — 21pp below median)\n  > rep_12: route to FinTech/SaaS only (60%/55% WR)\n    STOP assigning EdTech deals (26% WR — 19pp below median)\n\n  NEEDS COACHING — co-lead partnerships active:\n  > rep_19: paired with rep_23 on 4 HealthTech deals this month\n  > rep_06: paired with rep_12 on 3 FinTech deals this month\n  > Track RSFS improvement over next 2 quarters\n\nRevenue recoverable if coached reps reach industry median: ~$2.9M\n```\n\n### Insight Type: Weekly Digest (Automated Email/Slack)\n```\nWEEKLY SALES INTELLIGENCE DIGEST\nWeek of: Jan 15, 2024\n------------------------------------\n\nWin Rate:     43.6% (down 1.2pp from last week)\nPipeline:     $24.3M across 312 active deals\nAvg RSFS:     0.452 (stable — rep-industry matching unchanged)\n\nTop 3 things to know:\n1. Inbound lead win rate continues to decline (now at 40.5%)\n   — SMI is most negative of any segment; audit lead qualification\n2. Referral channel is the bright spot (50.6% win rate, improving)\n3. 12 deals flagged RED (RSFS < 25th percentile)\n   — co-leads assigned via top-3 round-robin\n\nCo-lead partnership update:\n  > 8 active co-lead pairings this week\n  > Expected lift on partnered deals: ~23pp\n  > 2 pairings closed won this week (both were RED-flagged)\n\nDriver update:\n  No significant shift in win rate drivers this week.\n  RSFS remains the dominant predictor (AUC 0.59 vs 0.48 for\n  deal characteristics alone). Biggest execution factor remains\n  rep-industry matching; biggest deal factor is velocity\n  (2-4 week closers win 8pp more than 1-2 month closers).\n```\n\n---\n\n## Cadence & Scheduling\n\n| Component | Frequency | Trigger | Latency Target |\n|-----------|-----------|---------|----------------|\n| CRM data sync | Every 6 hours | Cron job | < 5 min |\n| Metric computation | Daily 6 AM | Post-sync | < 10 min |\n| Alert evaluation | After metrics | Event-driven | < 1 min |\n| Co-lead matching | On deal creation/assignment | Webhook + daily batch | < 2 sec (webhook), < 5 min (batch) |\n| Driver model retrain | Weekly (Sunday) | Cron job | < 30 min |\n| Weekly digest | Monday 8 AM | Cron job | < 5 min |\n| Monthly rep audit | 1st of month | Cron job | < 15 min |\n\n---\n\n## Failure Cases & Limitations\n\n### Data Quality Failures\n\n| Failure Mode | Impact | Mitigation |\n|-------------|--------|------------|\n| CRM sync fails | Metrics computed on stale data | Retry with exponential backoff; alert ops team after 3 failures; show \"data as of [timestamp]\" in UI |\n| Missing fields (e.g., industry is null) | RSFS can't be computed | Fall back to rep's overall win rate; flag deal for CRM hygiene |\n| Duplicate deals | Inflated volume metrics | Deduplicate on deal_id + created_date; alert on anomalous volume spikes |\n| Outcome not yet recorded | Open deals mixed with closed | Strict filtering: only include deals with terminal outcome for historical metrics |\n\n### Model/Metric Failures\n\n| Failure Mode | Impact | Mitigation |\n|-------------|--------|------------|\n| Small sample size (new rep or rare industry) | RSFS is unreliable | Minimum deal threshold (n >= 5); fall back to rep overall rate, then global rate |\n| Concept drift (market changes) | Model becomes stale | Weekly retrain; monitor prediction calibration; alert when accuracy drops |\n| Simpson's paradox | Aggregate trends hide segment-level reversals | Always show both aggregate and segmented views |\n| Survivorship bias | Only analyzing closed deals misses currently stalling deals | Separate \"pipeline health\" view for open deals using RSFS + deal age |\n| Co-lead creates attribution ambiguity | Hard to tell if co-lead or original rep drove the win | Track outcomes separately for co-led vs. solo deals; attribute to partnership, not individual |\n\n### Business/Operational Failures\n\n| Failure Mode | Impact | Mitigation |\n|-------------|--------|------------|\n| Alert fatigue | CRO ignores alerts | Severity-based routing; max 3 alerts/week; only alert on actionable changes |\n| Misinterpretation | CRO takes wrong action based on metric | Always show context, confidence intervals, and sample sizes with every metric |\n| Correlation vs. causation | \"Low-RSFS reps cause losses\" (when it might be territory assignment) | Frame drivers as \"associated with\" not \"caused by\"; recommend investigation, not blind action |\n| Co-lead resistance | Reps resist partnership model (ego, comp concerns) | Frame as \"strategic advisor\" not \"takeover\"; ensure comp credit for both reps; show data on improved outcomes |\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack (if productized)\n\n| Layer | Technology | Why |\n|-------|-----------|-----|\n| Ingestion | Airflow/Dagster | Scheduled, observable pipelines |\n| Storage | PostgreSQL + time-series extension | Metric history needs time-series; deal data is relational |\n| Compute | Python (pandas, scikit-learn) | Same stack as analysis; easy to iterate |\n| Co-Lead Engine | Custom matching service (Python) | Top-3 round-robin with workload constraints; needs to be fast for webhook triggers |\n| Alerting | Custom rules engine + Slack/email API | Flexible thresholds per customer |\n| UI | Lightweight dashboard (Streamlit for MVP, React for prod) | CRO needs visual, not CLI |\n| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana | Track pipeline health and model performance |\n\n---\n\n## What This Would NOT Do (Scope Boundaries)\n\n- **Not a CRM replacement.** This reads from the CRM; it doesn't replace it.\n- **Not a forecasting tool (yet).** Revenue forecasting requires additional data (renewal dates, expansion pipeline). That's a Phase 2 feature.\n- **Not prescriptive AI.** It recommends investigation and co-lead pairings, not automatic actions. A human (the CRO or manager) always makes the final call on reassignment.\n- **Not real-time.** 6-hour sync is sufficient for strategic decisions. Real-time would add complexity without proportional value for this use case.\n- **Not a deal-profile scoring system.** Parts 2-3 showed deal characteristics don't predict outcomes. This system deliberately avoids \"deal quality scores\" based on industry/region/product combinations — those would give false confidence. The signal is in execution quality (RSFS), not deal demographics."
